------------------------------ MODULE lemma2_5 ------------------------------
EXTENDS Integers, Sequences, TLC, Boolean

CONSTANT N, F \* Set the total number of voters
ASSUME F < N/3 \* Ensure that the number of byzantine votrers are less than 1/3rd of total voters
\* Set the maximum number of Byzantine voters (f <= n/3)
--algorithm ByzantineVoting
variables honestVotes \in Seq(Boolen), byzantineVotes \in Seq(Boolean), allVotes, voteChannel





process HonestVoter(id) \* Honest Voter process with id
begin
  with x \in Boolean do \* Assume there are two choices (0 and 1)
    honestVotes[id] := x;
  end with;

  \* Send honest vote to central process
  await (allVotes[id] = 0); \* Wait until the central process reads the previous vote
  allVotes[id] := honestVotes[id];
  voteChannel!id; \* Notify the central process that a vote is ready
end process;


process ByzantineVoter(id) \* Byzantine Voter process with id
begin
  with x \in 0..1 do
    \* Byzantine voter votes arbitrarily; for simplicity, let's assume they vote 1 every time
    byzantineVotes[id] := 1;
  end with;

  \* Send Byzantine vote to central process
  await (allVotes[id] = 0); \* Wait until the central process reads the previous vote
  allVotes[id] := byzantineVotes[id];
  voteChannel!id; \* Notify the central process that a vote is ready
end process;


process CentralProcess \* Central process to collect votes
variables currentVoter, currentVote, count

begin
  allVotes := [i \in 1..n |-> 0]; \* Initialize votes to 0 for all voters
  voteChannel := 0; \* Initialize the channel for notifying votes
  count := 0; \* Counter for collected votes

  \* Receive votes from all voters (both honest and Byzantine)
  while count < n do
    await (voteChannel' # 0); \* Wait for a vote notification
    currentVoter := voteChannel; \* Identify the voter who sent the vote
    voteChannel := 0; \* Reset the channel

    \* Process the vote
    currentVote := allVotes[currentVoter];
    count := count + 1;
    \* Perform additional processing as needed
  end while;

  \* Assert some property based on the voting result
  assert (\* your condition based on allVotes \*);
end process;
