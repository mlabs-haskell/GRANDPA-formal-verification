(** Vote

From the paper:

<<
  A vote is a block hash, together with some metadata such as round number 
  and the type of vote, such as prevote or precommit, all signed with a 
  voterâ€™s private key
>>
  
Following the same approach as with the Blocks, we choose to replace the 
block hash with the real block. This makes proofs easier.

Round number would be added later when we add Time and Rounds, this 
  simplifies the work with a Vote.

We don't have types for votes, instead when needed, we distinguish
them by maintaining two different set of votes, one for precommits 
and other for prevotes.

However, we want to tie a Vote with a particular set of Voters 
and to ensure that the Vote is coherent.
