(** * Voters

(** 
Some requirements about a type that can represent voters:
   - It must have infinite inhabitants.
   - It must have decidable equality.
This means, we can have any number of voters and we can 
distinguish between them. 
For this reason we choose to use naturals.
*)
Definition Voter : Type := nat.


(**
  The bizantiners_number parameter isn't used 
   in the definition of the type, we 
   leave it open to any assumption. 
   Previously we had a constraint but 
   it wasn't useful and only complicate things.

  Ideally a Voters must be proper set, but we 
   don't want to complicate much the types.
  We may add a constraint in the constructor 
   to ensure that no voter is repeated in the 
   list, but it may complicate construction of 
   voters.

  Why not [Definition Voters nat := list Voter]?
  this would be equivalent to [list nat]. 
   We are going to work with multiple things 
   that are equivalent to [list nat]. This 
   means we should use the newtype pattern here.

  Note: Coq doesn't have a newtype syntax as 
   in Haskell, so we should use a variant.

(** ** Vote

From the paper:

<<
  A vote is a block hash, together with some metadata such as round number 
  and the type of vote, such as prevote or precommit, all signed with a 
  voterâ€™s private key
>>
  
Following the same approach as with the Blocks, we choose to replace the 
block hash with the real block. This makes proofs easier.

Round number would be added later when we add Time and Rounds, this 
  simplifies the work with a Vote.

We don't have types for votes, instead when needed, we distinguish
them by maintaining two different set of votes, one for precommits 
and other for previews.

However, we want to tie a Vote with a particular set of Voters 
and to ensure that the Vote is coherent.

Additionally a Vote depends on the [last_block], this is 
we are only interested in the blocks that are children of 
[last_block]. 

This means that [last_block] can be often interpreter as the 
_last_block_finalized_.
However this may not be the case in particular situations.

In Purescript the partition funtion returns a record like:

Then you can do [out.success] and [out.failures].

  This is the core function implementing supermajority.

   From the paper: 

<<
A voter equivocates in a set of votes [S] if they have cast multiple different 
votes in [S] . We call a set [S] of votes safe if the number of voters 
who equivocate in [S] is at most [f] . We say that [S] has a [supermajority]
for a block [B] if the set of voters who either have a vote for 
blocks [>= B] or equivocate in [S] has size at least [(n+f + 1)/2]. 
We count equivocations as votes for everything so that observing a vote 
is monotonic, meaning that if [S âŠ‚ T] then if [S] has a supermajority 
for [B] so does [T] , while being able to ignore yet more equivocating votes
from an equivocating voter.
>>

Our implementation aproach is as follows:

   - Find the equivocate votes and the ones that aren't equivocate.
   - Count the non equivocate votes for every block.
   - Remove blocks that don't have at least [(n+f+1)/2] votes.
      In this case [n:=length voters] and [f:= bizantiners_number]
