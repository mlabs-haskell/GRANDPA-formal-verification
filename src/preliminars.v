(* 
  In the paper they constantly use B < B' as blocks, using the fact
   that a block contains the hash of it's predecessor. To facilitate 
   our lives, we replaced the hash of the previous block with the 
   entire Block-Chain. This isn't wise in a real implementation,
   but would simplify our proofs.
   This means that whenever the paper compares two blocks we would 
   replace the statement with a equivalent one comparing two 
   Chains.
   Additionally we are choosing Vectors to represent a chain of blocks 
   since we are only interested in two things: 
   - Block number (provided by the index of the block in the chain)
   - A way to have different blocks.

(* 
  This corresponds to head(C) <= head(C').
  There exits various ways to define this relation but we believe 
  that this one would be quite useful.

(* 
   Is equivalent to the relation B ~ B' in the paper
   We express it like `(B <= B' ) /\ (B' <= B)` instead 
   of the one in the paper `B<B' /\ B=B! /\ B>B'` .
